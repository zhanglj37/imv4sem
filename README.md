# imv4sem

The InterModel Vigorish (IMV) index was initially developed to assess predictive performance in logistic regression with binary outcomes. We have since expanded this index for use in structural equation modeling (SEM) for model comparison (Zhang et al., 2023).   Our goal is to develop the `imv4sem` package, which will support model selection and predictive performance evaluation specifically for structural equation models.
